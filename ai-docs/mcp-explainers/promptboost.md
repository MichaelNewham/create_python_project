# PromptBoost Tools Guide

This document provides an overview of PromptBoost's capabilities as a VS Code Extension. PromptBoost helps improve the quality of prompts when working with AI models, making your interactions with GitHub Copilot and other AI assistants more effective.

## Prompt Enhancement

### 1. Enhance Prompt
**Question:** "I need to improve my prompt to get better AI-generated code. How can I make it more effective?"  
**Tool:** `promptBoost`  
**Description:** Takes your original prompt and analyzes it to suggest improvements, making it more specific, structured, and effective for AI models to understand and respond to accurately.

## Use Cases

### Improving Code Generation Prompts

**Question:** "I'm trying to get Copilot to generate a complex database schema, but it's not understanding all my requirements."  
**Workflow:** Use `promptBoost` to enhance your original prompt with more specific technical requirements.

### Clarifying Task Instructions

**Question:** "My prompt for generating a React component with specific state management isn't getting the results I want."  
**Workflow:** Use `promptBoost` to restructure your prompt with clearer sections for requirements, constraints, and expected behavior.

### Debugging AI Responses

**Question:** "GitHub Copilot keeps implementing the wrong algorithm for my sorting function."  
**Workflow:** Use `promptBoost` to improve your algorithm description and add explicit performance requirements.

### Learning Prompt Engineering

**Question:** "I want to get better at writing effective prompts for AI coding assistants."  
**Workflow:** Use `promptBoost` on your prompts and study the improvements it suggests to develop better prompt writing skills.

## Best Practices for Using PromptBoost

### 1. Start with Your Natural Language
Write your initial prompt in natural language describing what you need, then let PromptBoost enhance it with technical specificity and structure.

### 2. Review and Learn from Suggestions
Pay attention to how PromptBoost restructures your prompts to learn effective prompt engineering patterns you can apply in the future.

### 3. Include Context in Original Prompts
Even before enhancement, include relevant context such as your programming language, framework, and specific requirements to get better results.

### 4. Combine with Other Tools
For the best results:
- Use PromptBoost to enhance your initial prompt
- Use GitHub Copilot to generate code based on the enhanced prompt
- Use Context7 to provide relevant documentation
- Use Perplexity for research on implementation approaches

### 5. Iterative Refinement
If the enhanced prompt still doesn't yield the desired results, refine it further based on what you've learned and try again.

## Example Workflow

**Original Prompt:** "Create a user authentication system."

**Enhanced Prompt from PromptBoost:**
```
Create a secure user authentication system with the following specifications:

Technical Requirements:
- Programming language: Python 3.11+
- Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Authentication: JWT tokens with refresh capability
- Password storage: Bcrypt hashing with salt

Functionality Requirements:
- User registration with email verification
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset flow
- Role-based access control (admin, user)
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Session management

Security Considerations:
- Implement OWASP security best practices
- Protect against SQL injection
- Implement CSRF protection
- Include appropriate input validation

Please structure the code with:
- Clear separation of concerns (routes, services, models)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type annotations
- Unit tests for critical flows
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

PromptBoost works best when integrated into your development workflow:

1. **Planning Phase:** Use enhanced prompts to explore implementation options
2. **Development Phase:** Generate boilerplate and complex algorithms with precise requirements
3. **Testing Phase:** Create test cases with comprehensive edge cases
4. **Documentation Phase:** Generate detailed documentation with proper structure
