  Step 4: Project Context & Inspiration 🔧
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Help our expert AI team understand your vision by sharing context and inspiration.

  1. What problem are you solving?
  Describe the main problem or need your project addresses: I want to create a comprehensive 
  fitness tracking platform where people can log their workouts, track their nutrition, connect 
  with personal trainers, and get personalized fitness recommendations. Users should be able to 
  track their progress over time, share achievements with friends, and get motivated to reach 
  their fitness goals. I also want trainers to be able to manage their clients and create custom
   workout plans.

  2. Who will use this?
  Who are the end users? (developers, consumers, businesses, systems, etc.): Fitness 
  enthusiasts, personal trainers, gym members, people trying to lose weight or build muscle, 
  nutritionists, and fitness coaches. Both regular people who want to track their fitness 
  journey and professionals who help others with their fitness goals.

  3. What inspired this project?
  Examples, similar apps, or websites that inspired you: I love apps like MyFitnessPal for 
  nutrition tracking and Strava for workout sharing, but I want something that combines 
  everything - nutrition, workouts, social features, and professional trainer support all in one
   place. I also like how Nike Training Club has structured workout programs, and I want users 
  to be able to access both pre-made and custom programs from certified trainers.

  👥 Consulting with Anya Sharma (UX Lead)...
  Represented by: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
  ⠋ 👥 Anya analyzing user experience requirements...

  **Anya Sharma - UX Analysis:**

  Hello team! I'm excited to work on FitTracker Pro with you all. After analyzing Sarah's 
  vision, I see tremendous potential for creating a truly user-centered fitness ecosystem.

  **User Experience Priorities:**

  1. **Multi-User Experience Design**: We need to create distinct but interconnected experiences
   for:
     - Regular fitness enthusiasts (primary users)
     - Personal trainers and fitness professionals
     - Nutritionists and wellness coaches
     Each persona has different goals, workflows, and success metrics.

  2. **Mobile-First Approach**: Given the fitness context, users will primarily interact via 
  mobile devices during workouts, meal planning, and progress tracking. We need:
     - Intuitive one-handed navigation during workouts
     - Quick logging capabilities (voice commands, barcode scanning)
     - Offline functionality for gym environments with poor connectivity

  3. **Social Integration Without Overwhelm**: Users want community motivation but not social 
  media chaos. Design principles:
     - Opt-in sharing with granular privacy controls
     - Achievement celebrations that feel authentic, not gamified
     - Professional trainer-client communication channels separate from social features

  4. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Fitness apps often alienate beginners or people with 
  disabilities:
     - Inclusive language and imagery
     - Customizable UI for different fitness levels
     - Screen reader compatibility and voice navigation
     - Adaptable workout suggestions for various physical abilities

  5. **Data Visualization That Motivates**: Progress tracking should inspire, not overwhelm:
     - Personal dashboard highlighting meaningful trends
     - Goal-oriented progress indicators
     - Celebration of small wins alongside major milestones

  **Critical UX Recommendations:**
  - Implement progressive onboarding (users gradually discover features)
  - Create separate "Professional" and "Personal" interface modes
  - Design for intermittent usage patterns (users may take breaks from fitness routines)
  - Ensure seamless handoffs between trainer-created and self-directed content

  This platform has the potential to become the comprehensive fitness companion users have been 
  seeking. The key is balancing feature richness with interface simplicity.

     Phase 2: Leverage professional networks to acquire end users
     Phase 3: Scale through user-generated content and social features

  4. **Feature Prioritization Framework**:
     MVP Core: User registration, basic workout/nutrition logging, trainer-client connections
     Phase 2: Advanced analytics, social features, marketplace functionality
     Phase 3: AI recommendations, wearable integrations, corporate wellness programs

  **Key Business Metrics:**

  - Professional Adoption: 500 verified trainers within 3 months
  - Retention: 60% monthly active user retention
  - Revenue: $50k MRR by month 12 through subscription tiers

  **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Data privacy compliance (HIPAA considerations for health data)
  - Scaling infrastructure for 1,000+ concurrent users as mentioned
  - Competition from established players with deeper pockets

  **Success Indicators:**
  - Trainers using our platform report increased client engagement
  - Users achieve measurably better fitness outcomes compared to single-purpose apps
