Step 4: Project Context & Inspiration 🔧
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Help AI understand your vision by sharing context and inspiration.

1. What problem are you solving?
Describe the main problem or need your project addresses: I'm constantly struggling to keep track of my Revolut spending and it's becoming a real headache at tax time. Every month   I have to manually download CSV files from Revolut, open them in Excel, and try to categorize hundreds of transactions  by hand which takes hours. I end up with messy spreadsheets that don't give me clear insights into where my money is  actually going, and I often miss important business expenses or forget to separate personal from business spending. What  I really need is something that can automatically import my Revolut data, smart enough to learn my spending patterns, and   give me proper reports without all this manual work.

2. Who will use this?
Who are the end users? (developers, consumers, businesses, systems, etc.):   This would be perfect for busy professionals like me who use Revolut as their main bank but struggle with expense  tracking and financial organization. Small business owners and freelancers would love this because they need to separate  business expenses from personal spending for tax purposes, but don't want to pay expensive monthly fees for enterprise  accounting software. Even regular consumers who just want better budgeting tools would benefit - people who feel  overwhelmed by their spending and want clear, visual insights into their financial habits without becoming spreadsheet  experts.

3. What inspired this project?
Share websites, apps, or services you admire (URLs welcome):
Examples, similar apps, or websites that inspired you:   I love how Mint.com automatically categorizes transactions and shows you spending trends in beautiful charts, but it  doesn't work with Revolut and feels outdated. YNAB has great budgeting philosophy but it's too complex for casual users  and requires too much manual input. I want something that combines the automatic import and smart categorization of  modern fintech apps like Emma or Yolt, with the detailed reporting capabilities of business tools like Expensify, but  specifically designed to work seamlessly with Revolut's data format and built for people who aren't financial experts.

Step 6: AI Analysis & Recommendations 🤖

⠹ 🤖 Analyzing your project description...

✅ AI Analysis Complete!

Recommended Project Type: Desktop GUI
Desktop application with interactive graphical user interface elements. This project would be 
best suited as a native desktop application with a graphical interface (gui) because it involves 
visualizing financial data, categorizing transactions, and providing detailed reports. These 
features are typically easier to implement and more user-friendly in a desktop environment, 
especially for users who are not familiar with complex spreadsheet management or financial 
software. Additionally, a gui application can integrate machine learning for smart categorization
and provide clear visual insights into spending patterns, aligning well with the project's 
requirements to simplify financial management for non-experts.
