# Create Python Project Handover

## Project Overview
Create Python Project is an all-in-one Python project creator with intelligent setup based on project description and built-in AI integration. It provides a rich CLI interface to scaffold Python projects with best practices.

## Recent Work Summary
The most recent work focused on fixing f-string syntax errors in `project_templates.py` that were preventing proper linting and formatting. Specifically, there were errors reported on lines 1368 and 1377 related to f-string syntax:
- "src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py:1368: error: f-string: single '}' is not allowed [syntax]"
- "error: cannot format /home/michaelnewham/Projects/create_python_project/src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py: Cannot parse: 1377:4: f'\"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.3.0\",' if uses_typescript else ''"

The approach was to:
1. Analyze the problematic code in `_get_react_app()` and `_get_react_main()` methods
2. Extract conditional expressions that were inside f-strings into separate variables
3. Use those variables within the f-strings to avoid nesting issues
4. Run Black and other linting tools to verify the fixes

The fixes were successful as confirmed by Black formatting without errors. There are still some minor linting issues with whitespace and two type checking issues.

## Key Files and Components

### Main Application
- `/src/create_python_project/create_python_project.py`: Main entry point for the application with CLI interface

### Core Utilities
- `/src/create_python_project/utils/core_project_builder.py`: Core functionality for creating project structures
- `/src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py`: Templates for generating project files (recently fixed)
- `/src/create_python_project/utils/script_templates.py`: Generates automation scripts for development workflow
- `/src/create_python_project/utils/task_config.py`: Generates VS Code tasks.json with development workflow tasks

### AI Integration
- `/src/create_python_project/utils/ai_integration.py`: Manages connections with multiple AI providers
- `/src/create_python_project/utils/ai_prompts.py`: Contains prompt templates for different AI queries

### Linting and Code Quality
- `/scripts/lint_src.py`: Comprehensive linting script that runs Black, Ruff, and MyPy

## Development Commands

### Installation
```bash
# Install with Poetry (recommended)
poetry install --with dev

# Or with pip in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# With Poetry
poetry run python -m create_python_project.create_python_project

# Or after installing the package
create-python-project
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Type checking with mypy
poetry run mypy --config-file=.config/mypy.ini src/create_python_project

# Format code with Black (line length 88)
poetry run black src/create_python_project

# Linting and auto-fixing with Ruff
poetry run ruff check src/create_python_project --fix

# Security scanning
poetry run detect-secrets scan --all-files
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=src/create_python_project
```

## Pending Tasks
- Fix the MyPy errors:
  1. In line 67: Fix "Returning Any from function declared to return 'str'"
  2. In line 870: Fix "Name 'settings' is not defined"
- Fix whitespace issues in blank lines flagged by Ruff (these could be fixed by running `ruff --fix --unsafe-fixes`)
