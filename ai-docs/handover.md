## Recent Work Summary (June 4, 2025)

### Today's Accomplishments
- Fixed multiple issues in the codebase:
  1. Fixed a critical mypy configuration error in `.config/mypy.ini` that was preventing type checking from running
     - Identified and resolved an invalid regex pattern in the exclude option causing a "bad character range" error
     - Successfully ran mypy type checking, which now passes with no issues found in 18 source files
  2. Fixed runtime errors in project creation caused by incorrect f-string formatting
     - First, resolved the `name 'added' is not defined` error in `core_project_builder.py`
     - Then fixed a follow-up `Invalid format specifier` error in the same file
     - Found and fixed complex nested f-string issues in the script template generation
     - The project creator now correctly escapes template literals and generates valid Python scripts
  3. Performed a comprehensive review of all script template generation
     - Fixed f-string escaping issues in `clean_run.py` template 
     - Fixed multiple nested f-string issues in `script_templates.py`
     - Corrected template generation for error messages and status reporting
     - Added proper double-brace escaping for variable references in generated code
  4. Improved AI provider selection UI
     - Removed the 'skip AI analysis' option as it's not needed in this workflow
     - Simplified the selection interface to focus on the AI providers
     - Enhanced the prompt text to clearly indicate all available options
  5. Updated AI model references to use latest models (May 2025)
     - Updated OpenAI model to `gpt-4o-2025-05-13`
     - Updated Anthropic model to `claude-sonnet-4-0` 
     - Updated Gemini model to `gemini-3.5-pro-latest`

     - Updated .env.example file with the latest model references
  6. Enhanced AI project type detection
     - Improved the AI prompt format to be more explicit about expected response format
     - Added fallback keyword matching for project types when the exact format isn't found
     - Added detailed logging to help debug why the AI might fail to determine project type
  7. Implemented multi-selection for project types
     - Added ability to select multiple project types for hybrid projects (e.g., web + API)
     - Implemented comma-separated input parsing with intuitive UI
     - Provided clear visual feedback about primary and secondary project types
     - Gracefully handles invalid inputs with sensible defaults
- Created comprehensive documentation of f-string escaping patterns for code generation
- Added detailed error explanations and fixes in the `errors.txt` file
- Successfully tested script generation functionality to verify the fixes
- Documented key learnings about proper template escaping techniques

### Previous Work
The previous work focused on fixing f-string syntax errors in `project_templates.py` that were preventing proper linting and formatting. Specifically, there were errors reported on lines 1368 and 1377 related to f-string syntax:
- "src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py:1368: error: f-string: single '}' is not allowed [syntax]"
- "error: cannot format /home/michaelnewham/Projects/create_python_project/src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py: Cannot parse: 1377:4: f'\"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.3.0\",' if uses_typescript else ''"

The approach was to:
1. Analyze the problematic code in `_get_react_app()` and `_get_react_main()` methods
2. Extract conditional expressions that were inside f-strings into separate variables
3. Use those variables within the f-strings to avoid nesting issues
4. Run Black and other linting tools to verify the fixes

The fixes were successful as confirmed by Black formatting without errors.

## Revolutionary AI-Driven Workflow Implementation (January 2025)

### Major Architectural Achievement: Comprehensive Single-Step Analysis
Successfully implemented a revolutionary AI-driven project creation system that replaces traditional multi-step workflows with a single comprehensive analysis approach:

**What Was Built:**

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Dynamic Structure Detection Logic
```python
# Technology combination analysis determines project structure
has_frontend = any(frontend in tech["name"] for frontend in ["React", "Vue", "Angular"])
has_backend = any(backend in tech["name"] for backend in ["Django", "Flask", "FastAPI"])
has_gui_framework = any(gui in tech["name"] for gui in ["PyQt", "Tkinter", "Kivy"])

# Decision logic creates appropriate structure
if has_gui_framework and not has_frontend:
    return "gui_desktop"
elif has_frontend and has_backend:
    return "web_fullstack"
elif has_backend and not has_frontend:
    return "api_backend"
```

#### Universal Installation System
- Maps 50+ technologies to their installation commands
- Supports both Python (Poetry) and Node.js (npm) package ecosystems
- Handles technology variations and partial matches
- Provides installation summary with counts

### Solved Critical Issues
