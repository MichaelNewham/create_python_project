# Create Python Project Handover

## Project Overview
Create Python Project is an all-in-one Python project creator with intelligent setup based on project description and built-in AI integration. It provides a rich CLI interface to scaffold Python projects with best practices.

## Planned Enhancement: Intelligent Context Gathering System (November 2025)

### Project Instigator-Driven Question Framework

#### Overview
A comprehensive enhancement to the Create Python Project tool that replaces static context collection with an intelligent, adaptive question system driven by the "Project Instigator" AI persona. This system dynamically generates contextually relevant questions based on project type, user responses, and multimodal inputs to gather deeper, more strategic project insights.

#### Core Innovation: Adaptive Question Generation
Rather than asking the same questions for every project, the system uses AI to generate personalized, contextually relevant questions that adapt based on:
- Initial project description analysis
- User response patterns and depth
- Detected project complexity and domain
- Multimodal input analysis (screenshots, documents, URLs)
- Integration with existing expert consultation system

### Technical Architecture

### Previous Work
The previous work focused on fixing f-string syntax errors in `project_templates.py` that were preventing proper linting and formatting. Specifically, there were errors reported on lines 1368 and 1377 related to f-string syntax:
- "src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py:1368: error: f-string: single '}' is not allowed [syntax]"
- "error: cannot format /home/michaelnewham/Projects/create_python_project/src/create_python_project/utils/project_templates.py: Cannot parse: 1377:4: f'\"@types/react-dom\": \"^18.3.0\",' if uses_typescript else ''"

The approach was to:
1. Analyze the problematic code in `_get_react_app()` and `_get_react_main()` methods
2. Extract conditional expressions that were inside f-strings into separate variables
3. Use those variables within the f-strings to avoid nesting issues
4. Run Black and other linting tools to verify the fixes

The fixes were successful as confirmed by Black formatting without errors.

# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=src/create_python_project
```

## Project Status
The project is now free of mypy errors, with type checking passing successfully across all 18 source files. The previously pending mypy errors have been addressed by fixing the configuration issue. The project now also has improved AI type detection and support for multi-selection of project types, making it more flexible for hybrid projects.

## Next Steps
- Run full test suite to verify all functionality is working correctly
- Create a robust testing framework for template generation to catch template syntax errors earlier
- Add more detailed validation and error handling in the project creation process
- Implement a template verification system to check f-string syntax before attempting to use templates
- Review all other templates in the codebase for similar f-string escaping issues
- Consider refactoring template generation to use a dedicated templating engine instead of f-strings
- Add documentation about proper f-string template escaping to prevent similar issues in future development
- Ensure all error messages provide specific and helpful information for troubleshooting
- Add unit tests for the AI project type detection with different response formats
- Enhance multi-selection project type system to better incorporate secondary project types throughout the workflow
