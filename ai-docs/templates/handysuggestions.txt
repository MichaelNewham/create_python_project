 Problem Description (2-3 sentences minimum):

  I'm constantly struggling to keep track of my Revolut spending and it's becoming a real headache at tax time. Every month
   I have to manually download CSV files from Revolut, open them in Excel, and try to categorize hundreds of transactions
  by hand which takes hours. I end up with messy spreadsheets that don't give me clear insights into where my money is
  actually going, and I often miss important business expenses or forget to separate personal from business spending. What
  I really need is something that can automatically import my Revolut data, smart enough to learn my spending patterns, and
   give me proper reports without all this manual work.

  Target Users (2-3 sentences):

  This would be perfect for busy professionals like me who use Revolut as their main bank but struggle with expense
  tracking and financial organization. Small business owners and freelancers would love this because they need to separate
  business expenses from personal spending for tax purposes, but don't want to pay expensive monthly fees for enterprise
  accounting software. Even regular consumers who just want better budgeting tools would benefit - people who feel
  overwhelmed by their spending and want clear, visual insights into their financial habits without becoming spreadsheet
  experts.

  Inspiration Sources (2-3 sentences):

  I love how Mint.com automatically categorizes transactions and shows you spending trends in beautiful charts, but it
  doesn't work with Revolut and feels outdated. YNAB has great budgeting philosophy but it's too complex for casual users
  and requires too much manual input. I want something that combines the automatic import and smart categorization of
  modern fintech apps like Emma or Yolt, with the detailed reporting capabilities of business tools like Expensify, but
  specifically designed to work seamlessly with Revolut's data format and built for people who aren't financial experts.

  Alternative Example Sets

  Data Analysis Project Example:

  Problem Description:
  Our marketing team is drowning in data from different sources like Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, email campaigns, and
  sales reports, but we can't see the big picture because everything is scattered across different platforms. We spend more
   time copying and pasting numbers into PowerPoint presentations than actually understanding what the data means for our
  business decisions. The executives keep asking for insights that should be simple to answer, like which marketing
  channels actually drive profitable customers, but creating those reports manually takes our team days and the information
   is outdated by the time we present it.

  Target Users:
  Small to medium business marketing teams who understand their business but aren't data scientists or technical experts.
  These are people who know what questions they want to answer about their marketing performance, but don't have the
  technical skills to build complex database queries or write code to connect different data sources. They're currently
  using Excel and Google Sheets for everything, but they know there has to be a better way to automatically compile and
  visualize their marketing data without needing to hire expensive data analysts or learn complicated software.

  Inspiration Sources:
  We love how tools like Tableau and Power BI can create beautiful dashboards, but they're too expensive and complex for
  our small team to set up and maintain. HubSpot has great reporting features but only works with HubSpot data, and we use
  multiple platforms that don't integrate well. We want something as easy to use as Google Data Studio but more powerful,
  with the automatic data importing capabilities of Zapier, and the smart insights features we see in tools like Google
  Analytics Intelligence that can actually tell us what trends matter instead of just showing us pretty charts.

  Web Application Example:

  Problem Description:
  Planning events and coordinating with multiple people is always a nightmare because everyone uses different tools and
  nobody can agree on dates, venues, or who's bringing what. Group chats become chaos with important details getting lost
  in hundreds of messages, shared spreadsheets get outdated quickly, and email chains become impossible to follow. We end
  up with duplicate planning efforts, people showing up unprepared, and organizers getting stressed trying to keep track of
   everything manually across multiple platforms while making sure nothing falls through the cracks.

  Target Users:
  Anyone who organizes group events regularly - from friends planning birthday parties and family reunions to volunteer
  coordinators managing community events and small business owners organizing team activities. These are people who care
  about bringing people together but get frustrated with the logistical complexity and want to focus on making events fun
  rather than managing spreadsheets and coordinating communications. They're comfortable using social media and basic apps
  but don't want to learn complicated project management software just to plan a dinner party or office celebration.

  Inspiration Sources:
  Facebook Events is great for invitations and basic RSVP tracking, but it lacks detailed planning features and many people
   don't check Facebook regularly. Doodle polls work well for scheduling but don't help with the rest of event planning,
  and Google Sheets are functional but not user-friendly for people who just want to say whether they're bringing salad or
  dessert. We want something that combines the ease of WhatsApp group coordination, the visual appeal of Pinterest planning
   boards, and the organizational power of apps like Splitwise for shared expenses, but designed specifically for the
  complete event planning workflow that normal people actually use.

  CLI Tool Example:

  Problem Description:
  As a content creator, I'm constantly taking screenshots for tutorials, blog posts, and documentation, but organizing and
  optimizing them afterwards is incredibly tedious and time-consuming. I end up with hundreds of PNG files scattered across
   my desktop with names like "Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 3.47.23 PM" that tell me nothing about what they contain. I then
  have to manually rename each file, compress them for web use, resize them to standard dimensions, and organize them into
  the right project folders, which can take hours and often leads to me using oversized images that slow down my website or
   forgetting to optimize images entirely.

  Target Users:
  Content creators, bloggers, technical writers, and small business owners who regularly need to capture, organize, and
  optimize screenshots for their work but don't have time to become image editing experts. These are people who understand
  the importance of good visuals for their content but find the technical aspects of image management tedious and want to
  focus on creating content rather than file organization. They typically use basic tools like the built-in screenshot
  utilities and maybe Preview or Paint, but know their workflow could be much more efficient with better automation.

  Inspiration Sources:
  I love how tools like CleanMyMac can automatically organize and clean up files on my computer, and I wish there was
  something similar specifically for screenshots and images. Apps like ImageOptim are great for compression but require
  manual drag-and-drop for each file, while cloud services like Cloudinary have powerful optimization features but are
  overkill for individual creators. I want something as simple as using a keyboard shortcut to take a screenshot, but with
  the automatic organization and optimization capabilities of professional tools, similar to how Hazel can automatically
  organize downloads but specifically designed for the screenshot workflow that content creators use every day.
