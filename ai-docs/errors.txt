# Create Python Project - Error and Fix Log

## Initial Error
When running the application, the following error occurred:
```

  Building your Python project...

❌ Failed to create project: Failed to create project structure: name 'added' is not defined
```

## Root Cause
The error was found in the `commit_workflow.py` script template in `core_project_builder.py`. 

The issue was with the f-string formatting in the script template where double curly braces were used incorrectly:
```python
action_word = {{"A": "add", "M": "update", "D": "remove"}}.get(action, "change")
return f"{{action_word}}: {{file}}"

# And similar issues in the following f-strings referencing added, modified and deleted variables
parts.append(f"add {{len(added)}} file{'s' if len(added) > 1 else ''}")
```

In this case, Python was trying to interpret `{{action_word}}` as accessing a variable named `action_word` inside a dictionary literal, leading to the error when the code tried to reference the undefined variable `added`.

## Fix Applied
The issue was fixed by correcting the f-string syntax in `core_project_builder.py`:

1. Changed:
```python
action_word = {{"A": "add", "M": "update", "D": "remove"}}.get(action, "change")
return f"{{action_word}}: {{file}}"
```

2. To:
```python
action_word = {"A": "add", "M": "update", "D": "remove"}.get(action, "change")
return f"{action_word}: {file}"
```

Similar corrections were made to the f-strings referencing the `added`, `modified`, and `deleted` variables.

## Verification
After applying the fix:
- Type checking with mypy passes successfully
- The template code now correctly generates the project structure without the previous error
