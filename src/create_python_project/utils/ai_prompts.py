**CRITICAL PACKAGE NAMING REQUIREMENTS:**

For "name" field in technology options, you MUST use EXACT installable package names:
- Python packages: Use actual PyPI names (e.g., "fastapi", "flask", "psycopg2-binary", "elasticsearch")
- npm packages: Use actual npm names (e.g., "react", "vue", "@types/node", "express")
- System services: Use "install_type": "system" and provide setup instructions in description
- Custom components: Use "install_type": "manual" and provide build instructions

**INVALID EXAMPLES TO AVOID:**
❌ "Custom Python Agent" (not a real package)
❌ "Elasticsearch + Kibana" (multiple services, use separate entries)
❌ "Python (Flask/FastAPI)" (multiple options, pick one)
❌ "Vue.js or React" (multiple options, pick one)

**VALID EXAMPLES:**
✅ "fastapi" with install_type: "python"
✅ "react" with install_type: "npm"
✅ "postgresql" with install_type: "system"
✅ "monitoring-agent" with install_type: "manual"

Focus on:
1. Choose architecture that best solves the user's actual problems
2. Select technologies that work coherently together
3. Use ONLY real, installable package names or mark as system/manual
4. Consider the target users' technical expertise level
5. Ensure technologies support the key features needed

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the valid JSON object. Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text. Start your response with {{ and end with }}.
