## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MichaelNewham/create_python_project.git
cd create_python_project

# Install with Poetry (recommended)
poetry install

# Or with pip in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

This project requires some configuration for MCP and VS Code integration:

1. **Environment Variables**: Copy the example .env file and fill in your API keys
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

2. **VS Code Settings**:
   ```bash
   cp .vscode/settings.json.template .vscode/settings.json
   cp .vscode/mcp.json.template .vscode/mcp.json
   ```

- [VS Code Security Guide](docs/VSCODE_SECURITY.md)

## Usage

```bash
# With Poetry
poetry run python -m create_python_project.create_python_project

# Or after installing the package
create-python-project
```

The interactive process will guide you through:
1. Setting up your project name and location
2. Selecting an AI provider for recommendations
3. Describing your project for AI analysis
4. Selecting from AI-recommended technologies
5. Configuring additional options (Docker, CI/CD, etc.)
6. Creating the project with the optimal structure

## Development

```bash
# Install all dependencies including development dependencies
poetry install --with dev

# Run type checking to verify all issues are fixed
poetry run mypy --config-file=.config/mypy.ini src/create_python_project

# Test the application
poetry run python -m create_python_project.create_python_project

# Run AI integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_ai_integration.py -v

# Format code with Black
poetry run black src/create_python_project
```

## Project Organization

The project follows a clean organization structure:

... (truncated for brevity) ...


1. **OpenAI**: GPT-4o-mini and other OpenAI models
2. **Anthropic**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet and other Claude models
3. **Perplexity**: Sonar model for project analysis
4. **DeepSeek**: DeepSeek Chat model
5. **Gemini**: Gemini 2.5 Pro and other Gemini models

Each provider helps with:
- Project type detection based on your description
- Recommending appropriate technologies and libraries
- Suggesting optimal project structure
- Providing implementation guidance
