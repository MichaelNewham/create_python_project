Step 3: Project Description
Please describe your project (this helps with AI recommendations): I would like you to build a 'job-notification-processor' based in python that1. Has the following initial input >Emails from multiple job recruitment websites arrive into my inbox. They come from various agencies both public and private. They are automated and addressed to me. THey contain job title and brief job description. There maybe upwards of ten emails a day with each email in html containing snippets of multiple jobs based on my interests and perhaps a CV i uploaded already to their respective sites.2. Has the following result.A webpage at mycv.michaelnewham.me. It contains my cv for all to see and i can directly edit it. CV appears in the middle, section titles of the cv are on a left hand panel, conteact info on the right. At the bottom is a link to a seperate web page that is password protected and has 2fa. It's URL is jobs@michaelnewham.me. It contains all the snippets of the jobs that are a match between my CV and the job titles and descriptions etc. It is ordered by agency and by date.

Based on your description, I recommend a Browser-based application with HTML rendering and user interface components (Web Application).
The project requires a web interface for displaying and editing a CV, along with a
password-protected section for job listings, which necessitates a web application 
framework like Flask or Django to handle both the frontend presentation and 
backend processing of email data.

⠦ Analyzing optimal technology stack...
I've analyzed your project needs:
  Key feature needed: HTML email parsing to extract job details
  Key feature needed: Secure authentication with 2FA for job listings
  Key feature needed: Structured storage for job notifications with agency and 
date organization
  Key feature needed: Simple CV editing interface

Understanding Your Technology Stack Options:

Each technology category serves a specific purpose in your project. Here's what 
they do:

Backend Framework: The core framework for handling server-side logic and 
processing job notifications
Database: Storage for job notifications, user data, and CV information
Authentication: Secure access control for the password-protected jobs page
Frontend Technology: Technologies for building the interactive CV display and job 
listing interface
Data Processing: Tools for parsing and processing incoming job notification emails
Email Processing: Tools for handling incoming job notification emails
Deployment Options: Platforms for hosting the web application

Recommended Technology Stack:

🔹 Backend Framework - The core framework for handling server-side logic and 
processing job notifications
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will handle web requests, 
organize your code, and determine the project architecture</italic dim>
   Django ⭐ (AI recommended)
      A high-level Python web framework with built-in ORM, authentication, and 
admin interface, suitable for handling complex data processing and user management
      Best for: full-featured applications needing built-in admin, auth, and 
ORM</dim>
  [ ] Flask
      A lightweight Python web framework that offers flexibility but requires more
setup for authentication and database management
      Best for: lightweight applications with flexible routing and minimal 
constraints</dim>

🔹 Database - Storage for job notifications, user data, and CV information
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will store and retrieve data 
efficiently and securely</italic dim>
   PostgreSQL ⭐ (AI recommended)
      A robust, open-source relational database with strong support in Django, 
ideal for structured data like job listings and user profiles
      Best for: complex queries, relational data, and production applications 
requiring reliability</dim>
  [ ] SQLite
      A lightweight file-based database suitable for smaller-scale applications 
but less scalable
      Best for: development environments, small applications, or embedded 
databases</dim>

🔹 Authentication - Secure access control for the password-protected jobs page
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will secure user accounts and 
manage user sessions</italic dim>
   Django Allauth ⭐ (AI recommended)
      Integrated authentication solution for Django supporting 2FA, social auth, 
and password management
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>
  [ ] Auth0
      Third-party authentication service with 2FA support but adds external 
dependency
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>

🔹 Frontend Technology - Technologies for building the interactive CV display and 
job listing interface
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will influence a critical part
of your application</italic dim>
   HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Django Templates ⭐ (AI recommended)
      Standard web technologies integrated with Django's templating system for 
server-rendered pages
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>
  [ ] Vue.js
      JavaScript framework for more dynamic interfaces but adds complexity for 
this relatively simple display
      Best for: reactive applications with a gentler learning curve and excellent 
component system</dim>

🔹 Data Processing - Tools for parsing and processing incoming job notification 
emails
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will influence a critical part
of your application</italic dim>
   BeautifulSoup ⭐ (AI recommended)
      Python library for parsing HTML email content to extract job details
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>
  [ ] lxml
      Alternative HTML/XML parser with good performance but steeper learning curve
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>

🔹 Email Processing - Tools for handling incoming job notification emails
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will parse and extract 
information from incoming emails</italic dim>
   IMAPClient ⭐ (AI recommended)
      Python IMAP library for retrieving emails from the inbox
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>
  [ ] Mailgun API
      Email processing API if using a dedicated email service
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>

🔹 Deployment Options - Platforms for hosting the web application
   Why it matters: This determines how your project will influence a critical part
of your application</italic dim>
   PythonAnywhere ⭐ (AI recommended)
      Beginner-friendly Python hosting with email processing capabilities
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>
  [ ] Heroku
      Platform-as-a-service with good Django support but more complex setup
      Best for: projects that match its specific strengths and features</dim>
