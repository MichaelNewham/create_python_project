# FastMCP

A TypeScript framework for building [MCP](https://glama.ai/mcp) servers capable of handling client sessions.

- [Image content](#returning-an-image)
- [Audio content](#returning-an-audio)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Error handling](#errors)
- [SSE](#sse)
- [HTTP Streaming](#http-streaming)
- CORS (enabled by default)
- [Progress notifications](#progress)
- [Typed server events](#typed-server-events)
- [Prompt argument auto-completion](#prompt-argument-auto-completion)
- [Sampling](#requestsampling)
- [Configurable ping behavior](#configurable-ping-behavior)
- [Roots](#roots-management)
- CLI for [testing](#test-with-mcp-cli) and [debugging](#inspect-with-mcp-inspector)

## Installation

```bash
npm install fastmcp
```

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
>
> There are many real-world examples of using FastMCP in the wild. See the [Showcase](#showcase) for examples.

```ts
import { FastMCP } from "fastmcp";
import { z } from "zod"; // Or any validation library that supports Standard Schema

const server = new FastMCP({
  name: "My Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

server.addTool({
  name: "add",
  description: "Add two numbers",
  parameters: z.object({
    a: z.number(),
    b: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async (args) => {
    return String(args.a + args.b);
  },
});

server.start({
  transportType: "stdio",
});
```

_That's it!_ You have a working MCP server.

You can test the server in terminal with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp.git
cd fastmcp

pnpm install
pnpm build

# Test the addition server example using CLI:
npx fastmcp dev src/examples/addition.ts
# Test the addition server example using MCP Inspector:
npx fastmcp inspect src/examples/addition.ts
```

If you are looking for a boilerplate repository to build your own MCP server, check out [fastmcp-boilerplate](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp-boilerplate).

### Remote Server Options

FastMCP supports multiple transport options for remote communication, allowing an MCP hosted on a remote machine to be accessed over the network.

#### SSE

[Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) (SSE) provide a mechanism for servers to send real-time updates to clients over an HTTPS connection.

You can run the server with SSE support:

```ts
server.start({
  transportType: "sse",
  sse: {
    endpoint: "/sse",
    port: 8080,
  },
});
```

This will start the server and listen for SSE connections on `http://localhost:8080/sse`.

#### HTTP Streaming

[HTTP streaming](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/video/what-is-http-live-streaming/) provides a more efficient alternative to SSE in environments that support it, with potentially better performance for larger payloads.

You can run the server with HTTP streaming support:

```ts
server.start({
  transportType: "httpStream",
  httpStream: {
    endpoint: "/stream",
    port: 8080,
  },
});
```

This will start the server and listen for HTTP streaming connections on `http://localhost:8080/stream`.

You can connect to these servers using the appropriate client transport.

For SSE connections:

```ts
import { SSEClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse.js";

const client = new Client(
  {
    name: "example-client",
    version: "1.0.0",
  },
  {
    capabilities: {},
  },
);

const transport = new SSEClientTransport(new URL(`http://localhost:8080/sse`));

await client.connect(transport);
