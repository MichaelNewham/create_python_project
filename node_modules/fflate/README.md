# fflate
High performance (de)compression in an 8kB package

## Why fflate?
`fflate` (short for fast flate) is the **fastest, smallest, and most versatile** pure JavaScript compression and decompression library in existence, handily beating [`pako`](https://npmjs.com/package/pako), [`tiny-inflate`](https://npmjs.com/package/tiny-inflate), and [`UZIP.js`](https://github.com/photopea/UZIP.js) in performance benchmarks while being multiple times more lightweight. Its compression ratios are often better than even the original Zlib C library. It includes support for DEFLATE, GZIP, and Zlib data. Data compressed by `fflate` can be decompressed by other tools, and vice versa.

In addition to the base decompression and compression APIs, `fflate` supports high-speed ZIP file archiving for an extra 3 kB. In fact, the compressor, in synchronous mode, compresses both more quickly and with a higher compression ratio than most compression software (even Info-ZIP, a C program), and in asynchronous mode it can utilize multiple threads to achieve over 3x the performance of virtually any other utility.

## Demo
If you'd like to try `fflate` for yourself without installing it, you can take a look at the [browser demo](https://101arrowz.github.io/fflate). Since `fflate` is a pure JavaScript library, it works in both the browser and Node.js (see [Browser support](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate/#browser-support) for more info).

## Usage

Install `fflate`:
```sh
npm i fflate # or yarn add fflate, or pnpm add fflate
```

Import:
```js
// I will assume that you use the following for the rest of this guide
import * as fflate from 'fflate';

// However, you should import ONLY what you need to minimize bloat.
// So, if you just need GZIP compression support:
import { gzipSync } from 'fflate';
// Woo! You just saved 20 kB off your bundle with one line.
```

If your environment doesn't support ES Modules (e.g. Node.js):
```js
// Try to avoid this when using fflate in the browser, as it will import
// all of fflate's components, even those that you aren't using.
const fflate = require('fflate');
```

If you want to load from a CDN in the browser:
```html
<!--
You should use either UNPKG or jsDelivr (i.e. only one of the following)

Note that tree shaking is completely unsupported from the CDN. If you want
a small build without build tools, please ask me and I will make one manually
with only the features you need. This build is about 31kB, or 11.5kB gzipped.
-->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/fflate@0.8.2"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fflate@0.8.2/umd/index.js"></script>
<!-- Now, the global variable fflate contains the library -->

<!-- If you're going buildless but want ESM, import from Skypack -->
<script type="module">
  import * as fflate from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/fflate@0.8.2?min';
</script>
```

If you are using Deno:
```js
// Don't use the ?dts Skypack flag; it isn't necessary for Deno support
// The @deno-types comment adds TypeScript typings

// @deno-types="https://cdn.skypack.dev/fflate@0.8.2/lib/index.d.ts"
import * as fflate from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/fflate@0.8.2?min';
```


If your environment doesn't support bundling:
```js
// Again, try to import just what you need

// For the browser:
import * as fflate from 'fflate/esm/browser.js';
// If the standard ESM import fails on Node (i.e. older version):
import * as fflate from 'fflate/esm';
```

And use:
```js
// This is an ArrayBuffer of data
const massiveFileBuf = await fetch('/aMassiveFile').then(
  res => res.arrayBuffer()
);
// To use fflate, you need a Uint8Array
const massiveFile = new Uint8Array(massiveFileBuf);
// Note that Node.js Buffers work just fine as well:
// const massiveFile = require('fs').readFileSync('aMassiveFile.txt');

// Higher level means lower performance but better compression
// The level ranges from 0 (no compression) to 9 (max compression)
// The default level is 6
const notSoMassive = fflate.zlibSync(massiveFile, { level: 9 });
const massiveAgain = fflate.unzlibSync(notSoMassive);
const gzipped = fflate.gzipSync(massiveFile, {
  // GZIP-specific: the filename to use when decompressed
  filename: 'aMassiveFile.txt',
  // GZIP-specific: the modification time. Can be a Date, date string,
  // or Unix timestamp
  mtime: '9/1/16 2:00 PM'
});
```
`fflate` can autodetect a compressed file's format as well:
```js
const compressed = new Uint8Array(
  await fetch('/GZIPorZLIBorDEFLATE').then(res => res.arrayBuffer())
);
// Above example with Node.js Buffers:
// Buffer.from('H4sIAAAAAAAAE8tIzcnJBwCGphA2BQAAAA==', 'base64');

const decompressed = fflate.decompressSync(compressed);
```

Using strings is easy with `fflate`'s string conversion API:
```js
const buf = fflate.strToU8('Hello world!');

// The default compression method is gzip
// Increasing mem may increase performance at the cost of memory
// The mem ranges from 0 to 12, where 4 is the default
const compressed = fflate.compressSync(buf, { level: 6, mem: 8 });

// When you need to decompress:
const decompressed = fflate.decompressSync(compressed);
const origText = fflate.strFromU8(decompressed);
console.log(origText); // Hello world!
```

If you need to use an (albeit inefficient) binary string, you can set the second argument to `true`.
```js
const buf = fflate.strToU8('Hello world!');
