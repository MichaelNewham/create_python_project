2.0.0 / 2024-09-09
==================

* Drop support for node <18

  - `:name*` becomes `*name`.
  - The splat change also changes splat from strings to an array of strings
  - Optional splats become `{*name}`

2.0.0-beta.1 / 2020-03-29
=========================

This incorporates all changes after 1.3.3 up to 1.3.5.

  * Internalize private `router.process_params` method
  * Remove `debug` dependency
  * deps: array-flatten@3.0.0
  * deps: parseurl@~1.3.3
  * deps: path-to-regexp@3.2.0
    - Add new `?`, `*`, and `+` parameter modifiers.
    - Matching group expressions are only RegExp syntax.
      `(*)` is no longer valid and must be written as `(.*)`, for example.
    - Named matching groups no longer available by position in `req.params`.
      `/:foo(.*)` only captures as `req.params.foo` and not available as
      `req.params[0]`.
    - Regular expressions can only be used in a matching group.
      `/\\d+` is no longer valid and must be written as `/(\\d+)`.
    - Matching groups are now literal regular expressions.
      `:foo` named captures can no longer be included inside a capture group.
    - Special `*` path segment behavior removed.
      `/foo/*/bar` will match a literal `*` as the middle segment.
