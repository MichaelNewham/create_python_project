# Task Master

### by [@eyaltoledano](https://x.com/eyaltoledano)

A task management system for AI-driven development with Claude, designed to work seamlessly with Cursor AI.

## Requirements

- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- Anthropic API key (Claude API)
- Anthropic SDK version 0.39.0 or higher
- OpenAI SDK (for Perplexity API integration, optional)

## Configuration

Taskmaster uses two primary configuration methods:

1.  **`.taskmasterconfig` File (Project Root)**

    - Stores most settings: AI model selections (main, research, fallback), parameters (max tokens, temperature), logging level, default priority/subtasks, project name.
    - **Created and managed using `task-master models --setup` CLI command or the `models` MCP tool.**
    - Do not edit manually unless you know what you are doing.

2.  **Environment Variables (`.env` file or MCP `env` block)**
    - Used **only** for sensitive **API Keys** (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, etc.) and specific endpoints (like `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`).
    - **For CLI:** Place keys in a `.env` file in your project root.
    - **For MCP/Cursor:** Place keys in the `env` section of your `.cursor/mcp.json` (or other MCP config according to the AI IDE or client you use) file under the `taskmaster-ai` server definition.

**Important:** Settings like model choices, max tokens, temperature, and log level are **no longer configured via environment variables.** Use the `task-master models` command or tool.

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for full details.

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g task-master-ai

# OR install locally within your project
npm install task-master-ai
```

### Initialize a new project

```bash
# If installed globally
task-master init

# If installed locally
npx task-master init
```

This will prompt you for project details and set up a new project with the necessary files and structure.

### Important Notes

1. **ES Modules Configuration:**

   - This project uses ES Modules (ESM) instead of CommonJS.
   - This is set via `"type": "module"` in your package.json.
   - Use `import/export` syntax instead of `require()`.
   - Files should use `.js` or `.mjs` extensions.
   - To use a CommonJS module, either:
     - Rename it with `.cjs` extension
     - Use `await import()` for dynamic imports
   - If you need CommonJS throughout your project, remove `"type": "module"` from package.json, but Task Master scripts expect ESM.

2. The Anthropic SDK version should be 0.39.0 or higher.

## Quick Start with Global Commands

After installing the package globally, you can use these CLI commands from any directory:

```bash
# Initialize a new project
task-master init

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd your-prd.txt

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Generate task files
task-master generate
```

## Troubleshooting

### If `task-master init` doesn't respond:

Try running it with Node directly:

```bash
node node_modules/claude-task-master/scripts/init.js
```

Or clone the repository and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master.git
cd claude-task-master
node scripts/init.js
```

## Task Structure

Tasks in tasks.json have the following structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the task (Example: `1`)
- `title`: Brief, descriptive title of the task (Example: `"Initialize Repo"`)
- `description`: Concise description of what the task involves (Example: `"Create a new repository, set up initial structure."`)
- `status`: Current state of the task (Example: `"pending"`, `"done"`, `"deferred"`)
- `dependencies`: IDs of tasks that must be completed before this task (Example: `[1, 2]`)
  - Dependencies are displayed with status indicators (✅ for completed, ⏱️ for pending)
  - This helps quickly identify which prerequisite tasks are blocking work
- `priority`: Importance level of the task (Example: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"`)
- `details`: In-depth implementation instructions (Example: `"Use GitHub client ID/secret, handle callback, set session token."`)
- `testStrategy`: Verification approach (Example: `"Deploy and call endpoint to confirm 'Hello World' response."`)
- `subtasks`: List of smaller, more specific tasks that make up the main task (Example: `[{"id": 1, "title": "Configure OAuth", ...}]`)

## Integrating with Cursor AI

Claude Task Master is designed to work seamlessly with [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.so/), providing a structured workflow for AI-driven development.

### Setup with Cursor

1. After initializing your project, open it in Cursor
2. The `.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc` file is automatically loaded by Cursor, providing the AI with knowledge about the task management system
3. Place your PRD document in the `scripts/` directory (e.g., `scripts/prd.txt`)
4. Open Cursor's AI chat and switch to Agent mode

### Setting up MCP in Cursor

To enable enhanced task management capabilities directly within Cursor using the Model Control Protocol (MCP):

1. Go to Cursor settings
2. Navigate to the MCP section
3. Click on "Add New MCP Server"
4. Configure with the following details:
   - Name: "Task Master"
   - Type: "Command"
