# Overview  
Create Python Project is an all-in-one Python project creator designed to streamline the initial setup process for Python developers. It offers an intelligent, interactive command-line interface (CLI) that leverages AI to recommend project structures, technologies, and configurations based on user descriptions. The tool integrates with various AI providers and is optimized for users working in a Linux environment with VS Code as their IDE.

# Core Features  
## Interactive CLI
- Rich, colorful interface with clear prompts and intelligent defaults
- Step-by-step guidance through the project creation process
- Comprehensive logging system for setup and error tracking

## AI-Powered Project Analysis
- Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Gemini)
- AI-based detection of project type and recommended technology stack
- AI-suggested optimal project directory structure

## Project Configuration Options
- Customizable project name and location
- Selection of AI provider for recommendations
- Support for various project types with pre-defined templates
- Docker, CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, and Git repository configuration
- VS Code workspace file generation with pre-configured tasks

## Code Generation and Structure
- Generation of a clean, organized project structure following best practices
- Inclusion of basic boilerplate code relevant to the project type
- Creation of README.md, .gitignore, and other essential project files

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- Python developers of all skill levels
- Developers working on Linux-based systems
- Users of Visual Studio Code as their primary IDE
- Individuals or teams looking to quickly bootstrap new Python projects

## Key User Flows
- User describes their project in natural language
- AI analyzes description and suggests project type and technologies
- User selects from AI-recommended options or customizes further
- Tool generates the complete project structure and initial files
- User receives a fully configured VS Code workspace

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- Core Project Builder: Handles the creation of project files and directories
- AI Integration Module: Manages communication with AI providers
- CLI Interface: Provides the user interaction layer
- Configuration Manager: Handles user preferences and settings
- Template Engine: Generates project files based on templates
- Logging System: Tracks operations and errors

## Data Models
- Project Configuration: Stores user selections and preferences
- AI Provider Settings: Manages API keys and provider-specific configurations
- Project Templates: Defines structures for different project types
- Generated Files: Maps file templates to their destinations

## APIs and Integrations
- OpenAI API: For GPT-based project analysis
- Anthropic API: For Claude-based project analysis
- Perplexity API: For Sonar-based project analysis
- DeepSeek and Google APIs: For alternative AI providers
- Git Integration: For repository initialization and configuration
- VS Code Integration: For workspace and tasks setup

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Python 3.8+ runtime environment
- Poetry for dependency management
- Access to AI provider APIs
- Local filesystem access for project creation

# Development Roadmap  
## MVP Requirements
- Basic CLI interface with project creation options
- Support for at least one AI provider (e.g., OpenAI)
- Core project structure generation for common Python project types
- Git repository initialization
- Basic VS Code integration with workspace file generation

## Phase 2: Enhanced AI Integration
- Add support for multiple AI providers
- Implement AI-based project type detection
- Add AI-recommended technology selection
- Improve project structure suggestions based on AI analysis

## Phase 3: Advanced Configuration Options
- Add Docker configuration generation
- Implement CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Add pre-commit hook configuration
- Support dual remote Git repositories (GitHub and GitLab)

## Phase 4: User Experience Improvements
- Enhance CLI with rich, colorful interface
- Add progress indicators and visual feedback
- Implement comprehensive logging system
- Add project structure visualization

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Template customization and saving
- Project generation history
- Integration with additional development tools
- Support for more complex project structures

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation Components
1. Core project creation functionality without AI
2. Basic CLI interface
3. Simple template system for project structure
4. Logging system for tracking operations

## Initial User-Facing Features
1. Basic AI integration with one provider
2. Project type detection and suggested structure
3. VS Code workspace generation
4. Git repository initialization

## Progressive Enhancements
1. Multiple AI provider support
2. Enhanced project structure recommendations
3. Docker and CI/CD configuration
4. Advanced Git setup with dual remotes
5. Rich CLI interface improvements

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- AI API reliability and cost: Implement fallback mechanisms and rate limiting
- Cross-platform compatibility: Focus on Linux first, then extend
- Template maintenance: Implement modular template system for easier updates

## MVP Scope Management
- Focus on core project creation functionality first
- Prioritize features most valuable to Linux/VS Code users
- Implement AI integration incrementally, starting with one provider

## Resource Constraints
- Implement efficient AI usage to minimize API costs
- Use Poetry for dependency management to simplify environment setup
- Leverage existing libraries where possible to reduce development effort
